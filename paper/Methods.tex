\subsection{Software}
\subsubsection{Coq}
Coq is a theorem proving software made by Inria, a French-government supported computer science research institute. Out of the many theorem proving software out there, Coq was chosen due to its use in previous research into formally verified code translators \autocite{Roziere}\autocite{Zhao}.
\subsubsection{Python}
Python 2.7.18 was chosen as the source language for Transpyler due to it being the latest release of Python 2. Python 3.9.17 was chosen as the target language due to Python 3.9 being the lastest Python 3 version supported by 2to3 \autocite{2to3}.
\subsection{Method}
\subsection{Analysis}
The metric used for evaluating the effectiveness of Transpyler was \textit{computational accuracy}, a metric used by Roziere et al. in their evaluation of their AI-based code translator \autocite{Roziere}. Computational accuracy
